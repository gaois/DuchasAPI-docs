# Dúchas Application Programming Interface (Version 0.5): Data dictionary

**Note:** This documentation describes a prerelease version of the Dúchas API. Features are being added on an ongoing basis. URLs in this document refer to the test.duchas.ie test domain. These links and other aspects of the documentation will be revised in advance of the v1.0 release.

This document describes the data structure of the collections made available via the Dúchas Application Programming Interface (API). Dúchas is a project is to initiate the digitization of the [National Folklore Collection](https://www.ucd.ie/irishfolklore/en) (NFC).

## The Main Manuscript Collection (CBÉ)

The Main Manuscript Collection consists of stories, accounts, questionnaires, diaries and other materials which have been physically bound into volumes. Each volume is represented in the data set by a `volume` entity, and each page by a `page` entity. Each `page` entity also contains a reference that identifies the scanned image of the page. Together, `volume` and `page` entities represent the collection’s **physical structure**. In parallel to the physical structure, a **logical structure** exists which annotates and indexes the physical structure. It consists of `part` and `item` entities.

A `part` entity represents a distinct section within a manuscript volume and may have originally been physically separate from the other contents of the volume. It is consonant with the [`msPart`](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#mspt) element as specified in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 Guidelines. An `item` entity represents a discrete work, such as a story or diary entry. It is consonant with the TEI [msItem](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#mscoit) element. Notice that mapping between items and pages is many-to-many: an item can span over several pages and a page can accommodate several items. An `item` entity also contains detailed data about the people who were involved in its writing, the subject to which it pertains and other data.

Queries to the Main Manuscript Collection may return one or more `volume` objects. The information below describes the properties of this object type.

## The Schools' Collection (CBÉS)

The Schools' Collection consists of stories and accounts which have been physically bound into volumes. Each volume is represented in the data set by a `volume` entity, and each page by a `page` entity. Each `page` entity also contains a reference that identifies the scanned image of the page. Together, `volume` and `page` entities represent the collection’s **physical structure**. In parallel to the physical structure, a **logical structure** exists which annotates and indexes the physical structure. It consists of `part` and `item` entities. 

A `part` entity represents a distinct section within a manuscript volume and may have originally been physically separate from the other contents of the volume. It is consonant with the [`msPart`](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#mspt) element as specified in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) P5 Guidelines. It the Schools' Collection a `part` contains material collected by a single school. In the case of schools where multiple teachers and/or class groups took part in *Scéim na Scol* folklore collection scheme there may be multiple `part` entities associated with a single school. In the previous Schools' Collection XML-based API manuscript parts were referred to as **chapters**.

An `item` entity represents a discrete work, such as a story. It is consonant with the TEI [msItem](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#mscoit) element. Notice that mapping between items and pages is many-to-many: an item can span over several pages and a page can accommodate several items. An `item` entity also contains detailed data about the people who were involved in its writing, the subject to which it pertains and other data. In the previous Schools' Collection XML-based API manuscript items were referred to as **stories**.

Queries to the Schools' Collection may return one or more `volume` objects. The information below describes the properties of this object type.

### Schools' Collection `person`

Due to the scope of the Schools' Collection digitisation project it has not yet been feasible to extract a normalised set of personal metadata. Instead, the initial phases of the project sought to capture information about the persons referred to within the collection 'as is'. Thus, the same individual may be referenced by more than one `person` entity.
